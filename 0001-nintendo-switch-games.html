<h2> Nintendo Switch Games You Can Play With Your Family And Friends </h2> 
<p> Hi! My name is Srikar, and I like video games. They're fantastic! Here's a list of great Nintendo Switch games to play with your family and friends. </p>  
<h3> 1. Overcooked 2 </h3>
<p> The Onion Kingdom is in peril again but this time, the Onion King himself is to blame. After reading aloud from the fabled Necronomnomicon, he has cooked up a whole new problem in the form of an Undead Bread army called The Unbread. Players will need to chop, fry, and bake their way through all-new crazy kitchens to defeat this new foe and save the kingdom once more.</p>
<p>Overcooked! 2 is a game for 1-4 players. Play solo or team up with friends either local on the couch or online and cook up a ton of brand new recipes. Overcome obstacles such as fire, collapsing floors, overbearing waiters, and floating work surfaces. </p>
<p> This game is awesome, but your family might need to get used to it a bit, due to some mildly complex controls. Nevertheless, it's a great game!
<h3> 2. Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle </h3> 
<p> Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is a turn-based tactical title for Nintendo Switch that crosses-over the Mario franchise with Ubisoft's Rabbids series. It is the only tactics game in the Mario franchise, and also incorporates some role-playing elements.</p>
<p> This game is quite unusual indeed. Everyone knows what the Super Mario franchise is, but practically no one knows who the Rabbids are. It's as if a British princess married a hot dog vendor.
<p>The Mushroom Kingdom is getting ready to commemorate the unveiling of a statue of Princess Peach, when the Rabbids appear and cause mayhem. (Notice how Peach doesn't get kidnapped?) There are 3 good Rabbids who join your side, and you have to battle the Rabbids using cartoon-ish weapons. </p>
<h3> 3. Just Dance 2020 </h3>
<p> Gather your friends and family and Just Dance like nobody's watching with Just Dance 2020! The 1 Music Video Game Franchise of All Time, with over 67 million units sold, is back this Fall. The newest, freshest Just Dance celebrates 10 years of bringing people together with 40 new hot tracks, more stunning universes and exclusive surprises for the players to discover! </p>
