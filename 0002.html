<h4>10-09-20 to 10-12-20</h4>
<p> Recently I went to Show Low. We arrived there on the evening of 10-9. </p>
<p> During the stay, we rented a cabin. The home was amazing. The cabin was in the forest, on the outskirts of Show Low, AZ.  </p>
<p> We played billiards and darts throughout our stay. There were 3 TV's. One of them was a Toshiba TV/VCR. They even had a few cassetes. What amazes me is how well kept the TV was, after all these years. </p> 
<p> The living room had 20 foot windows, allowing us to gase at the stars in the living room.</p>
<p> In my parent's room, there was a balcony, perfect for stargazing. </p>
<p> Around the cabin was a 3 acre land plot. It has a 1 mile trail, a tree house, and plenty of animals.
<p> On 10-10, we went to the Petrified Forest National Park. Petrified is really underrated, compare to other landmarks. Petrified Forest is more than just petrified wood. There are amazing rock formations, like Blue Mesa, and a fossilized tree bridge, known as Agate Bridge. </p>
<p> On the next day, 10-11, we drove to Hawley Lake. The drive to Hawley Lake is stunning, marvellous, and I simply cannot describe how beautiful the drive, Hawley Lake, and Petrified Forest is. In fact, I'll share some photos as well.
<p> Our trip to Show Low was stunning, marvellous, and fun altogether. If you live in Arizona, do check out Show Low, Hawley Lake, and Petrfied Forest. They are very beautiful places, indeed.</p
