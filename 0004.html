<h2> Out of Africa </h2>
<p> On March 19, we went to "Out of Africa", a wildlife park in Campe Verde, AZ. Out of Africa features mostly African animals. They feature birds, reptiles, and mostly mammals.</p>
<p> At 11 AM, we wnt to the bus tour. The bus tour featured giraffes, zebras, tigers, lions, warthogs, hyenas, leopards, and rhinos. Our tour guide said he could be inside all of the animal's cages, but not the hyena's. Hyenas are very social and they live in clans. They are a matriarchal society, so the males follow the females, or they get punished and injured. Our tour guide was male, and he couldnt understand the hyenas, since he wasn't one. What was very interesting was that all the animals had unique backstories to them. The wildlife employees don't see their park as a zoo, nor themselves as zookeepers. They were friends to the animals. </p>
<p> At 12:45, we saw the Tiger Splash, which is an event there. The event started with a brief speech by the owner of the park. He said that tigers are very smart. Instead of eating the humans, which would benefit them in the short term, they think in the long term, and befriend the humans. Now, this wasn't a circus act. They wanted to show the tiger in its natural state. The tigers did several acts, such as jumping in the hoops, and splashed in a pool in the arena. At the end of the event, they let us feed the tigers.</p>
<p> After Tiger Splash, we visited the snake event. The Out of Africa Employees brought out several snakes. The Owner of OUt of Africa also came. He talked about his travels in Africa and gave some commentary about the snakes. The Out of Africa employees also let us pet the snakes.</p>
<p> Soon after, we went to the zip line. Out of Africa has a 50 foot tall zip line (6 of them, actually!). They were ment for the zip line tour, so we got to do one. It was frightening at first, but after I set off, it was super fun! I also got to see some of the animals on the ground!</p>
<p> After that, we headed home after a day of excitement and fun. Out of Africa was a very interesting place, and we learned a lot. I can't wait to visit again!</p>
