<h3>Payson And Flagstaff</h3>
<p>Hello, everyone. For winter break, I went to Payson and Flagstaff, AZ. We stayed there from 12-26-2020 to 12-31-2020. Throughout our trip, we went to numerous wonderful places, and I want to show you all about it.</p>
<p>On the 26th, we arrived at our rental home. The rental home was cozy. There was a fire place next to the TV. Also, there was a dining table and a kitchen. Near the dining table was a painting by Vermeer. It wasn't the acual painting, though. It was just a copy.</p>
